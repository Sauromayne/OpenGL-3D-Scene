# OpenGL 3D Scene
 Simple OpenGL render of a house
## SKills learned:
1. OpenGL Programming: I gained experience in utilizing the OpenGL library to create 3D graphics and render objects in a virtual environment.

2. 3D Modeling: Through the creation of the house, cube, and pyramid shapes, I acquired skills in 3D modeling concepts and techniques.

3. Geometry and Primitives: I became proficient in defining and manipulating geometric primitives such as cubes and pyramids, including their vertices, faces, and texture coordinates.

4. Texturing: I applied textures to the surfaces of the cube and pyramid, demonstrating my ability to map 2D images onto 3D objects in OpenGL.

5. Shaders: I utilized shaders to control the lighting, shading, and appearance of the objects in my OpenGL render.

6. Coordinate Systems: I successfully positioned and oriented objects within a 3D coordinate system, employing transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling.

7. Rendering Pipeline: I developed a deep understanding of the stages involved in the OpenGL rendering pipeline, including vertex processing, primitive assembly, rasterization, and fragment processing.

8. Problem Solving and Debugging: Throughout the project, I encountered and resolved challenges, honing my problem-solving and debugging skills.

9. Code Organization and Modularity: I implemented a modular structure for my code, utilizing separate files for different functionalities such as object creation, rendering, and texture handling. This approach improved code organization and maintainability.

10. Computer Graphics Concepts: The project provided me with practical knowledge of fundamental computer graphics concepts such as polygons, textures, transformations, and rendering techniques.
